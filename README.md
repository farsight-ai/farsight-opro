- **Automated Testing:** Robust testing features for reliability and accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Design:** Intuitive and straightforward to use, regardless of your expertise level.

## Installation

Install the Farsight OPRO SDK with ease:

```bash
pip install farsight-opro
```

## Usage

Dive into the world of optimized prompt engineering with Farsight's OPRO SDK, an implementation inspired by the innovative [OPRO paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03409). Whether you're working on a small project or a large-scale application, our SDK adapts to your needs.

Begin optimizing promptly with this simple setup. For comprehensive guidance, visit our detailed [documentation](https://api.farsight-ai.com/farsight-opro/).

```bash
from opro import FarsightOPRO

# Define your datasets
train_set, examples, test_set = # ...

# Initialize with your OpenAI key
farsight = FarsightOPRO(openai_key=OPEN_AI_KEY)

# Get optimized prompts
prompts_and_scores = farsight.get_prompts(train_set, examples, test_set)
```

### Full Example:

```bash
from opro import FarsightOPRO
import json
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Set your OpenAI credentials
farsight = FarsightOPRO(openai_key="<openai_key>")

# Load your dataset
dataset_path = "/opro/src/bbh/movie_recommendation.json"
with open(dataset_path, "r") as file:
    data = json.load(file)

# Split the dataset
examples = data["examples"][:3]  # Choose 3 examples for the prompt
train_set, test_set = train_test_split(data["examples"], train_size=0.20)

# Train and get prompts with scores
prompts_and_scores = farsight.train(train_set, examples, test_set)

# Output example
#  [{
#    "prompt": "Select a movie matching the genres, popularity, critical acclaim, and quality of provided examples for accurate recommendations.",
#    "train_score": 0.94,
#    "test_score": 0.88
#   }, ...]
```
